# Crypto Clustering Project

## Introduction

The Crypto Clustering Project is designed to analyze and visualize the cryptocurrency market's dynamics by employing clustering techniques. This project makes use of machine learning to group cryptocurrencies based on their performance across different time periods. Our methodology integrates K-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to optimize the clustering process, providing insights into the underlying patterns of crypto market movements.

## Features
- Data Preparation: Normalization of cryptocurrency market data for clustering.
- K-means Clustering: Utilizes the original and PCA-transformed data to identify optimal clusters within the cryptocurrency market.
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reduces dimensionality to optimize clustering results.
- Visualization: Offers comprehensive plots to visualize the clustering outcomes and the efficiency of PCA optimization.
